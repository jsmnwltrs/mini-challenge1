         <p>My name is Jasmine and, like my dad, I have trouble taking serious pictures of myself. I'm
              a huge nerd that likes anime, manga and video games. I love dogs and always wanted to rescue 
              a few when I have the time to care for them. I love to cook which is fortunate because my 
              favorite thing to do is eat. I'm really excited about this class and hope it helps me 
              jumpstart my dream to become a game developer.</p>

            <p>My favorite dinosaur is the Stegosaurus! They might have been herbivoires, but they were 
                very tough creatures. They were alive during the late Jurassic period (over 150 million years ago!).
             Even though they were huge animals that weighed over 5 metric tons, their brains were only 
             the size of an average dog's.</p>
